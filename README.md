# Learn the Chinese Family Tree

## Purpose

Knowing what to call a family relative in Chinese can be difficult, especially when compared to English. This app seeks to make it easy to understand how to name a relative by partitioning the family tree by gender, age, father's/mother's lineage, blood/in-law, and generation.

## Resources

- [Chinese Family Tree 1](http://blog.tutorming.com/mandarin-chinese-learning-tips/family-tree-relatives-in-chinese)
- [Chinese Family Tree 2](https://ltl-school.com/complicated-chinese-family-tree/)

## Objectives

- Create a family tree using circular nodes with portraits
- Focus app on "You"
- Allow scrolling up for older generations
- Allow scrolling down for younger generations
- Click for more info, e.g. alternative naming in dialects
- Search for an equivalent in English, e.g. User searches "cousin" and all possible "cousins" are highlighted
- Show how the logical partitions are used to determine naming, e.g. generation, father's/mother's lineage
- Allow nodes to be moved around to create custom family trees with appropriate naming

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
